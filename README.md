# PRODIGY_CS_03

The Password Complexity Checker is a comprehensive tool designed to evaluate the strength and security of passwords. This project aims to enhance cybersecurity by providing users with detailed feedback on their password choices, ensuring that they meet essential complexity requirements and are resistant to common attacks.

# Features
Strength Assessment: Evaluates password strength based on length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. <br />
Common Password Detection: Identifies passwords that are commonly used and therefore more vulnerable to attacks. <br />
Dictionary Attack Protection: Checks against a database of commonly used words and phrases to prevent easily guessable passwords. <br />
Pattern Recognition: Detects and warns against common patterns like "123456" or "password". <br />
Entropy Calculation: Calculates the entropy of the password to provide a quantifiable measure of its unpredictability. <br />
Real-Time Feedback: Offers instant suggestions for improving password complexity as the user types.  <br />
Multi-Language Support: Provides password checks and feedback in multiple languages. <br />
User-Friendly Interface: Features a simple and intuitive interface that is easy for users to navigate. <br />
# Implementation
Programming Language: Utilizes Python for its robust string handling and cryptographic libraries. <br />
# Security Considerations
Encryption: All data transmission is secured using HTTPS to prevent interception. <br />
Anonymity: Ensures user privacy by not storing any passwords entered into the checker. <br />
Updates: Regular updates to the common passwords and dictionary databases to keep up with evolving security threats. <br />
